Modelling and forecasting electricity price and demand
========================================

Goal of the thesis is to receive the best performing regression-type models for forecasting of demand and prices in the Danish day-ahead power market. Different explanatory variables and different sets of rolling windows and transformation methods are considered. The best results were obtained usually with models containing exogenous parameters and using 728 days-length window, either HP filter or asinh transformation method depending on the area and the predicted period, but with exceptions.
