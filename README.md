Modelling and forecasting electricity price and demand
========================================

The goal of the thesis is to find the best performing regression-type model
forforecasting of consumption (as a proxy for the demand for electricity), wind
generationand prices in the Danish day-ahead power market. Different explana-
tory variables anddifferent sets of rolling windows and transformations are con-
sidered. The best resultswere obtained usually for models containing exogenous
variables and using 728-daywindows, often utilizing the Hodrick-Prescott filter
and/or the asinh transformation.
